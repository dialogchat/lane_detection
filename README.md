# Lane Detection
## Overview
Different approaches to find lane-lines on roads. The code is mostly based on Udacity's [self driving car program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013).

## Dependencies

Use Python 3.6 and install virtualenv (virtual environment)
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev python-virtualenv
``` 
Go to your home directory and create a virtualenv environment
```
virtualenv --system-site-packages lane_detection
```
Activate the virtualenv environment (use ```deactivate``` to exit)
```
source ~/lane_detection/bin/activate
```
Clone the Repo, cd into the folder and install all other dependencies in the requirements.txt file:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Simple Lane Detection

### Advanced Lane Detection

### Advanced Lane Detection with Object Detection

### SegNet Lane Detection



## Credits

The credits for this code go to [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity) and [georgesung](https://github.com/georgesung/advanced_lane_detection). I  mainly refactored the code and did some bugfixes.
